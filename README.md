# Healthcare Data Analysis - Heart Failure Prediction Dashboard

## Overview
This Tableau project is centered around visualizing and analyzing heart failure data. The goal is to explore factors that influence survival rates among patients with heart failure, using various data visualization techniques. The dashboard enables healthcare professionals to make informed decisions by providing insights into the impact of different medical conditions on patient outcomes.

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Donut Charts - **Survival Status by Categorical Variables**
The dashboard includes five donut charts that illustrate the survival status (survived or died) based on key categorical variables such as anemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, sex, and smoking status. These visualizations help in understanding the impact of these factors on patient survival.

### 2. Histograms - **Survival Status by Continuous Variables**
Histograms visualize continuous variables like age, serum creatinine, serum sodium, ejection fraction, platelets, and creatinine phosphokinase, comparing the distribution of these variables among patients who survived versus those who did not.

### 3. Box and Scatter Plots - **Relationship between Variables**
Box plots and scatter plots are used to analyze the relationship between different variables such as age, sex, and survival status. These plots are crucial for understanding trends and correlations in the data.

### 4. KPIs - **Key Performance Indicators**
The dashboard also highlights key metrics such as the total number of individuals, total deaths, total males, total females, and the average age of patients. These KPIs provide a quick overview of the dataset's essential statistics.
